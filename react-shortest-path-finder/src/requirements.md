## Shortest Path Finder:
The GUI we will create using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Components of the GUI:
1. Grid
2. Control Panel

GUI and the control panel behaviors:
1. For the start and stop cells we want different indicators maybe color/logo.
2. The user should be able to drag the start cell inorder to change the position
of start cell and same goes for the stop cell.
3. Then if the user drags over some other cells which are not start or stop cells then 
the wall should appear in those cells and we will represent the walls using some color.
4. The control panel should include:
a) Button to reset the grid.
b) Button to start the shortest path finding visualization.
c) Dropdown to adjust speed of the visualization.
5. Once the shortest path from the start cell to end cell is found the path should 
be drawn using some color.
